					Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years ago, I have done remote work for
					agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create web products for
					both business and consumer use.
					<br />
					<br />
					I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.
					The main area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web
					apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
					<br />
					<br />I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source CMS like (WordPress,
					Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js and others). <br />
