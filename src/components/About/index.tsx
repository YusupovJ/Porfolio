					Since Adobe Flash was a complete innovation, alongside with CSS 1.0 and HTML 4.01 as standards of
					the current web I have been passionate about web. <br /> <br /> For over a decade I had many
					opportunities to work in a vast spectrum of <Link href="/skills">web technologies</Link> what let me
					gather a significant amount of various experience. Working for companies and individuals around the
					globe I met and learnt from amazing and ambitious people. <br /> <br /> I currently work remotely
					with a selected freelance client base being open for new opportunities.
